Purpose
This Python script processes multiple pairs of audio and data files by:

Converting .mp3 files to .wav format.
Extracting various acoustic features from the .wav files at specified time points.
Updating a corresponding CSV file with the extracted features.
Saving the updated CSV files to an output directory.
The script is designed to handle batch processing of multiple audio files and their associated data files.

Inputs
Directory Structure:

input_output/input: Contains the .mp3 audio files and their corresponding _data_info.csv files.
input_output/output: The directory where the processed CSV files will be saved.
File Naming Conventions:

Audio files: <file_name>.mp3
Data files: <file_name>_data_info.csv
For example, an audio file named example.mp3 should have a corresponding data file named example_data_info.csv in the same directory.

Outputs
Updated CSV Files: Saved in the output directory with the naming convention <file_name>_data_info_updated.csv.
